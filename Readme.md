## Project Description

The Universal Musculoskeletal Ultrasound Repository (UMUD) is a Streamlit-based web application designed to provide easy access to metadata about muscle ultrasonography datasets. The app allows users to filter datasets based on various criteria, such as muscle type, image type, device, and age, and retrieve links to the relevant datasets. At the moment, UMUD is more of a webapp and not a python package. 

The UMUD project is part of the [ORMIR](https://www.ormir.org/) community as a seperate [working group](https://www.ormir.org/groups.html#). 

**We are currently in the beta-testing mode. No real datasets are integrated yet!**

## Features

- üìÅ **Variety of Data**: Includes images, videos, and 3DUS data.
- üè∑Ô∏è **Labeled Datasets**: Focus on datasets that include labels for better training and validation.
- üîç **Metadata Indexing**: Comprehensive indexing of metadata for easy search and retrieval.
- ‚ú® **Analysis Standards**: Provide benchmark datasets and models analysed by experts in the field.
