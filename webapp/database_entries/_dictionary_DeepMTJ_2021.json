    "DATA_LABELS_DESCRIPTION": "Manually set labels in the training dataset denote exact pixel positions of estimated MTJ positions in the image and images were labelled by a total of four raters. For our training, we used soft labeling, where we assigned probability values to each image pixel. We used probability maps at the same resolution as original images, where we modeled positions of the MTJ by a 2D normal distribution with a covariance of 100 pixels at positions of specialist labels.",
    "SHORT_DESCRIPTION": "Data were collected at the University of Graz, the Graz University of Technology and the University of Queensland between 2014 and 2020 on 123 healthy and 38 impaired individuals inclduing children and adults. With 1590 recordings, the isometric maximum voluntary contractions (MVC) and passive torque movements (PT) on the medial gastrocnemius (MG) had the largest share in the dataset. A smaller amount of data was collected on the MG during running (48 recordings). The measurements on the lateral gastrocnemius (LG) consist of 109 recordings. The complete and fully anonymous dataset holds 1747 video recordings with a mean length of 19.84 seconds per video. Sequences were captured at frame-rates of 30 frames per second (fps) for studies with an Aixplorer V6 (SuperSonic Imagine, Aix-en-Provence, France) US system (Aixplorer), 25 fps for studies with the Esaote MyLab60 system (Esaote), and 30-80 fps for the Telemed ArtUs US (Telemed), respectively. The scanning frequency varied between 7 to 9 MHz.",
