    "SHORT_DESCRIPTION": "The dataset assembles pairs of Ultrasound volumes and 3-labels muscles of the low-limb leg from 44 healthy volunteers, aged between 18 and 45 years, with an average height of 173\u00b111 cm and body mass of 64.3\u00b112.4 kg.Three-dimensional arrays are in MetaImage Medical Format (MHA), with an average voxel grid of 564\u00d7632\u00d71443 (\u00b149\u00d738\u00d7207), with an isotropic voxel spacing of about 0.276993 mm\u00b3 (\u00b10.015 mm\u00b3). The ultrasound imaging utilized a 40mm linear VERMON probe with a frequency range of 2-10 MHz, and an Aixplorer, Supersonic Imagine Ultrasound machine. The tracking of the ultrasound probe was meticulously performed with a 6-camera Optitrack system. During the scans, participants were positioned prone with their leg in a custom-made bath, ensuring minimal pressure influence on the measurements. Multiple parallel sweeps, ranging from the knee to the ankle and recorded every 5 mm in low-speed mode, were conducted. The resulting high-resolution 3D ultrasound volumes were compounded using the tracking matrices of the probe, offering an unprecedented level of detail and accuracy in musculoskeletal imaging. The annotations, carried out by two double-blinded experts, focused on evaluating intra-operative volumetric error, which was found to be as low as 4%.",
