    "SHORT_DESCRIPTION": "This dataset presents an investigation into the feasibility of using deep learning methods for developing abitrary full spatial resolution regression analysis of B-mode ultrasound images of human skeletal muscle. Dynamic ultrasound images sequences of the calf muscles were acquired (25 Hz) from 8 healthy volunteers (4 male, ages: 25 to 36, median 30). Here, the labels correspond to the extrapolated fascicles including curvature, not only visible fascicle fragments.",
