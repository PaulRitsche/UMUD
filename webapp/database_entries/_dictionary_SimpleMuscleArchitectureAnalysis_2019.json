    "SHORT_DESCRIPTION": "Ultrasound images of muscle architecture were acquired using LogicScan 128 EXT-1Z systems with transducers LV7.5/60/96Z and HL9.0/60/128Z-2, at scanning frequencies of 9–12 MHz, to analyze the gastrocnemius medialis and tibialis anterior and Phillips HD11 at scanning frequency from 5-12 MHz. Data were collected from 15 participants, with optimized settings for fascicle and aponeurosis visualization. To assess the influence of different ultrasound settings, three sample groups were analyzed: Sample A: Scans of the gastrocnemius medialis from 15 individuals, acquired at 9 MHz using a 96-element transducer (60 mm, LV7.5/60/96Z, LogicScan 128 EXT-1Z, Telemed, Lithuania). Sample B: Additional scans of the gastrocnemius medialis from 15 individuals, taken at 12 MHz with a 128-element transducer (50 mm, 5–12 MHz HD11XE, Phillips, Bothell, Washington, USA). Sample C: Dynamic scans of the tibialis anterior, acquired at 12 MHz using a 128-element transducer (60 mm, HL9.0/60/128Z-2, LogicScan 128 EXT-1Z, Telemed, Lithuania), recorded at 15 frames per second during unconstrained dorsiflexion-plantarflexion movements.",
