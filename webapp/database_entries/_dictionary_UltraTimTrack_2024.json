    "SHORT_DESCRIPTION": "In this study, a Kalman filter was applied to combine fascicle length and fascicle angle estimates from existing and openly available UltraTrack and TimTrack algorithms into a hybrid algorithm called UltraTimTrack. The study utilized a Telemed LV8-5N60-A2 linear ultrasound transducer, scanning at frequencies of 33-100 Fps, with synchronized data acquisition at 2 kHz. Data were collected from 8 healthy participants (4 women, 4 men; age: 26 ± 3 years; height: 174 ± 6 cm; weight: 70 ± 7 kg) during submaximal plantar flexion contractions and passive ankle joint rotations.",
