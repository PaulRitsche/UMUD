    "SHORT_DESCRIPTION": "This dataset comprises data used for the analyses of hamstring muscle adaptations following 9 weeks of eccentric training and 3 weeks of detraining, focusing on fascicle lengths measured via 3D ultrasound, sarcomere lengths obtained through microendoscopy, and knee flexor force assessed using load cells. Alongside these measurements, the dataset includes all relevant data used for statistical analyses, presented in CSV files. These data provide detailed insights into the multiscale adaptations of hamstring muscles to eccentric training and detraining periods. Note that the downloadable dataset does not only contain 3DUS images but other data from the study as well.",
