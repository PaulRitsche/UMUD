If you have muscle ultrasound datasets that you would like to share with the scientific community, you can contribute them to the UMUD database. 
**Important:** Make sure you have permission to share the data openly. UMUD is not responsible for any ethical or legal issues that may arise from sharing your data.

**Why Contribute?**  
By sharing your data, you help create a valuable resource for researchers and developers. Your contribution can lead to new discoveries and advancements in muscle research.

**How to Contribute Your Data - Step by Step:**

1. **Prepare Your Data:**
    - Make sure your data is properly labeled and formatted according to UMUD standards.  
    - Use the metadata entryfields below to create a metadata .json file for your data.   
    - Upload your data to a reliable repository like [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/) or [OSF](https://osf.io/). Include the link to your dataset in the metadata dictionary.
    - If your dataset includes different populations (e.g., young vs. old individuals), please upload each population as a separate dataset. This makes the data easier to reuse.
    - Organize your images according to our [sample dataset LINK](https://osf.io/xbawc/?view_only=f1b975a4ef554facb48b0a3236adddef).
